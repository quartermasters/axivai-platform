# Contributing to AXIVAI Platform

We love your input! We want to make contributing to AXIVAI as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests Process

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

### Development Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/axivai-platform.git
cd axivai-platform

# Install dependencies
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
cd frontend && npm install

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Run tests
pytest backend/tests/
npm test --prefix frontend
```

## Code Style

### Python (Backend)
- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints
- Maximum line length: 88 characters
- Use Black for formatting: `black backend/`
- Use isort for imports: `isort backend/`

### JavaScript/TypeScript (Frontend)
- Use ESLint configuration provided
- Prefer functional components with hooks
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Maximum line length: 100 characters

### Commit Messages
- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Example:
```
Add investor matching algorithm

- Implement compatibility scoring
- Add portfolio analysis
- Update API endpoints

Fixes #123
```

## Testing

### Backend Tests
```bash
# Unit tests
pytest backend/tests/unit/

# Integration tests  
pytest backend/tests/integration/

# Coverage
pytest --cov=backend/ backend/tests/
```

### Frontend Tests
```bash
# Unit tests
npm test --prefix frontend

# E2E tests
npm run test:e2e --prefix frontend
```

## Bug Reports

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Feature Requests

We welcome feature requests! Please:

1. Check if the feature already exists or has been requested
2. Clearly describe the feature and its benefits
3. Consider the scope and complexity
4. Provide examples or mockups if helpful
